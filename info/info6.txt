- use connectorcreate to create relationship easily instead of search all db if it already exists
-- find where hashtag is food
-- if it does not exist then create it
 client.photo.create({
          data: {
            file,
            caption,
            hashtags: {
              connectOrCreate: [
                {
                  where: {
                    hashtag: "#food",
                  },
                  create: {
                    hashtag: "#food",
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
        });
